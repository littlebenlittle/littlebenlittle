# Ben Little

### Software Engineer, Computer Scientist, and Mathematician

I'm a software engineer who's obsessed with building simple, correct, and understandable applications. My number one goal is to help people not only use but also understand computers.

For me, simplicity, correctness, and understandability are ethical imperatives. As a computer expert designing software for non-technical users, I acknowledge the power imbalance that is inherent to that relationship and accept responsiblity for the impact that my applications have on users.
