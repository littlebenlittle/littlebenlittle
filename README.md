Hello, computer systems researcher here.

I have experience with formal semantics and automated reasoning. I'm passionate
about writing code that is both **correct** and **easy to understand**, and
**efficient** when it is not a detriment to the previous two properties.

I want to work on projects with **transformative social impact**, including but
not limited to **secure communication**, **resource sharing**, and **mutual
support**. Sorry, I won't work on your gambling application.

I mostly write code in **Rust** for its excellent static analysis suite, but
have also written code in most major languages including **C**, **Go**, and
**Python**. I have also worked with some more domain-specific languages like
Coq, Prolog, and a little bit of TLA+. I am comfortable debugging and reasoning
about assembly, compilers, and interpreters.
